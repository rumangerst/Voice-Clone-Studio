#### Version 1.11.0 - VibeVoice 7B Training, Split by Paragraph & Bug Fixes

**VibeVoice 7B Training**
- **7B Base Model Support** - Train VibeVoice LoRA models using the 7B base for higher quality output (requires more VRAM)
- **Base Model Selector** - New radio toggle in Train Model to choose between 1.5B and 7B before training
- **Model Metadata** - Trained models now include `vcs_metadata.json` in the LoRA folder, recording which base model was used — transfers correctly when sharing models

- **Multiline Text Fix** - Fixed pre-existing bug where multiline text only generated the first line with VibeVoice Trained models

**Bug Fixes**
- **Faster-Qwen3-TTS ICL Fix** - Fixed voice cloning quality degradation when using CUDA Graphs acceleration; the library defaulted to speaker-embedding-only mode (`xvec_only=True`) instead of full ICL with reference audio in context (thanks to [Mixomo](https://github.com/Mixomo) for identifying the root cause)
- **Whisper Batch Transcribe Fix** - Fixed undefined variable (`size` → `asr_size`) in Prep Audio's Whisper batch transcription that caused crashes when using non-default Whisper model sizes

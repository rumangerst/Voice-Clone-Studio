## Architecture

Voice Clone Studio is fully modular. The main file dynamically loads self-contained tools as tabs. Each tool can be enabled or disabled from Settings without touching any code.  It supports multipe engine for voice cloning, as well as Model finetuning. More features are also planned.

## Features

### Voice Clone
Clone voices from your own audio samples. Provide a short reference audio clip with its transcript, and generate new speech in that voice.

- **Multiple engines** - Qwen3-TTS (0.6B/1.7B) or VibeVoice (1.5B/Large/Large-4bit)
- **Voice prompt caching** - First generation processes the sample, subsequent ones are instant
- **Seed control** - Reproducible results with saved seeds
- **Emotion presets** - 40+ emotion presets with adjustable intensity
- **Split by Paragraph** - Generate a separate audio clip for each paragraph, with automatic naming and a combined preview
- **Prompt Hub** - Access saved prompts directly from the tool without switching tabs
- **Metadata tracking** - Each output saves generation info (sample, seed, text)

### Conversation
Create multi-speaker dialogues using either Qwen's premium voices or your own custom voice samples using VibeVoice:

**Choose Your Engine:**
- **Qwen** - Fast generation with 9 preset voices, optimized for their native languages
- **VibeVoice** - High-quality custom voices, up to 90 minutes continuous, perfect for podcasts/audiobooks
- **LuxTTS** - 

**Unified Script Format:**
Write scripts using `[N]:` format - works seamlessly with both engines:
```
[1]: Hey, how's it going?
[2]: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
[3]: Mind if I join this conversation?
```

**Qwen Mode:**
- Mix any of the 9 premium speakers
- Adjustable pause duration between lines
- Fast generation with cached prompts

**Speaker Mapping:**
- [1] = Vivian, [2] = Serena, [3] = Uncle_Fu, [4] = Dylan, [5] = Eric
- [6] = Ryan, [7] = Aiden, [8] = Ono_Anna, [9] = Sohee

**VibeVoice Mode:**
- **Up to 90 minutes** of continuous speech
- **Up to 4 distinct speakers** using your own voice samples
- Cross-lingual support
- May spontaneously add background music/sounds for realism
- Numbers beyond 4 wrap around (5→1, 6→2, 7→3, 8→4, etc.)

Perfect for:
- Podcasts
- Audiobooks
- Long-form conversations
- Multi-speaker narratives

**Models:**
- **Small** - Faster generation (Qwen: 0.6B, VibeVoice: 1.5B)
- **Large** - Best quality (Qwen: 1.7B, VibeVoice: Large model)


### Voice Changer

## Troubleshooting
For troubleshooting solutions, see [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

#### Docker Setup (Windows)

1. **Install NVIDIA Drivers (Windows Side)**
   - Install the latest standard NVIDIA driver (Game Ready or Studio) for Windows from the [NVIDIA Drivers page](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).
   - **Crucial:** Do *not* try to install NVIDIA drivers inside your WSL Linux terminal. It will conflict with the host driver.

2. **Update WSL 2**
   - Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and ensure your WSL kernel is up to date:
     ```powershell
     wsl --update
     ```
   - (If you don't have WSL installed yet, run `wsl --install` and restart your computer).

3. **Configure Docker Desktop**
   - Install the latest version of **Docker Desktop for Windows**.
   - Open Docker Desktop **Settings** (gear icon).
   - Under **General**, ensure **"Use the WSL 2 based engine"** is checked.
   - Under **Resources > WSL Integration**, ensure the switch is enabled for your default Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu).

4. **Run with Docker Compose**
   - Run the following command in the repository root:
     ```powershell
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

### Running Tests (Docker)

To verify the installation and features (like the DeepFilterNet denoiser), runs the integration tests inside the container:

```powershell
# Run the Denoiser Integration Test
docker-compose exec voice-clone-studio python tests/integration_test_denoiser.py
```

## Usage

### Launch the UI

```bash
python voice_clone_studio.py
```

Or use the launcher scripts:
```bash
# Windows
launch.bat

## Models Used

Each tab lets you choose between model sizes:

| Model | Sizes | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Qwen3-TTS Base** | Small, Large | Voice cloning from samples |
| **Qwen3-TTS CustomVoice** | Small, Large | Premium speakers with style control |
| **Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign** | 1.7B only | Voice design from descriptions |
| **LuxTTS** | Large | Voice cloning with speaker encoder |
| **VibeVoice-TTS** | Small, Large | Voice cloning & Long-form multi-speaker (up to 90 min) |
| **Chatterbox** | TTS, Multilingual | Speech-to-speech voice conversion |
| **VibeVoice-ASR** | Large | Audio transcription |
| **Whisper** | Medium | Audio transcription |
| **MMAudio** | Medium, Large v2 | Sound effects generation (text & video to audio) |

- **Small** = Faster, less VRAM (Qwen: 0.6B ~4GB, VibeVoice: 1.5B)
- **Large** = Better quality, more expressive (Qwen: 1.7B ~8GB, VibeVoice: Large model)
- **4 Bit Quantized** version of the Large model is also included for VibeVoice.

Models are automatically downloaded on first use via HuggingFace.

## Tips

- **Reference Audio**: Use clear, noise-free recordings (3-10 seconds)
- **Transcripts**: Should exactly match what's spoken in the audio
- **Caching**: Voice prompts are cached - first generation is slow, subsequent ones are fast
- **Seeds**: Use the same seed to reproduce identical outputs
